# AppleScript
A bunch of AppleScript Scripts meant to help do cool things!

## .applescript vs .workflow
`.applescript` files need to be opened with the Script Editor app. They can then be saved as a script (`.scpt`) and run or used by other applescripts or workflows.
`.workflow` files need to be opened with the Automator app. 


## Scripts
###Speak In Japanese
A script I wrote becuase I like Japanese. This will allow you to highlight any Japanese text and have it read aloud to you by right clicking it and selecting this script as a service. I find it particularly useful for reading Kanji or fonts that obscure characters.

### Five Languages of Love Quiz
I recently read "The Five Love Languages" by Gary Chapman and saw that there was a quiz at the end to discover your Love Language. I love taking quizes, so I re-made a simple version of the quiz that allows a user to walk trough some UI prompts to discover your Love Language.

### Brithday Script
One of my 2017 Resolutions was to send out more physical cards to people I care about. I made a  script that scans a user's contacts and looks for brithdays in the next X days and creates a calendar event as a reminder to send a card. Despite the fact that the script is called ```BrithdayReminder``` it actually alerts the user as to birthdays, anniversaries or other type of events. It should run on a daily cron so the user doesn't have to run it themselves (they can if they like).
